          <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA") and other California laws require that we provide additional disclosures about our personal information handling practices related to residents of California. These Supplemental California Privacy Disclosures ("California Disclosures") supplement the information in our Privacy Policy.</p>

          <p>We collect different types of personal information for a variety of purposes as described in our Privacy Policy. In addition, the CCPA requires businesses to disclose whether they collect certain categories of personal information and whether they "sell" and/or share such information for a "business purpose" (as those terms are defined under California law). The following table describes the categories of California residents' personal information we have collected and disclosed for our business purposes in the preceding twelve months. We do not sell personal information.</p>

          <p>You may submit a request to exercise your applicable rights by following the instructions described below. We will need to verify your identity before processing your request. The information that we ask you to provide to verify your identity will depend on your prior interactions with us and the sensitivity of the personal information at issue. For example, we may ask you to submit a notarized form verifying your identity, or we may use a third-party vendor to provide identity verification services. Additionally, if you have a password-protected account with us, we may verify your identity through our existing authentication practices for your account. However, you are not required to create an account with us to submit a request.</p>

Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge. We currently do not share any of your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>
